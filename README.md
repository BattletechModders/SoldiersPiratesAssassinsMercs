# SoldiersPiratesAssassinsMercs

**Depends On MissionControl and IRBTModUtils!** 

This mod breathes a little life into the mercenaries of the Inner Sphere, allowing mercenary factions to jump in and replace the opfor at contract start. Depending on the configuration, the hostile mercs may replace the opfor entirely, or they may only replace AdditionalLances added by MissionControl. The lance difficulty *should* be approximately the same, as the mod works by simply changing the faction for the replaced units and re-selecting appropriate lances and units.
